The contents of this directory are:

   LICENCE	    The GNU public licence
   Makefile         Unix makefile for all of svLis

Directories and files marked * above are created by make, and will therefore 
not exist immediately after svLis has been downloaded and before make has
been run.  

Svlis needs the OpenGL library to do graphics.  On a Silicon Graphics
computer you should have this; for Linux and for Suns see:

    http://www.mesa3d.org/   and
    http://www.opengl.org/

All systems also need the GL User Toolkit (GLUT), obtainable from the
same websites.  Install OpenGL and GLUT and get them working before
making svLis.

To make svLis, edit the Makefile and do what it says at the top:

  #
  #                    The SvLis Geometric Modelling Kernel
  #                    ------------------------------------
  #   
  # 
  # This Makefile is intended for GNU make (usually gmake on most systems)
  # If you haven't got it, see http://www.gnu.org/
  #
  # 
  # ===========================================================================
  #
  # Uncomment (remove the # from the beginning of) the line for the type of 
  # machine you're on:
  #

  MACHINE = LINUX
  #MACHINE = SGI
  #MACHINE = SUN

  # then type gmake.
  #
  # ============================================================================
  #
  .
  .
  .
  .

That one would be for Linux.

To test svLis after gmaking it, run

   bin/sv_tst_1

from this directory.  Then run

   bin/sv_tst_2

and then

   bin/sv_tst_g
