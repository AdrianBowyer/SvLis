                 Macintosh svLis Notes
                 =====================

This directory contains the svLis CSG kernel geometric modeller.  For
up-to-date information and documentation see:

   http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ensab/G_mod/Svlis

This Build requires

 CodeWarrior Pro 4 or later
 Apple OpenGL Libraries 1.0b1 or later
 Apple OpenGL SDK 1.0b1 or later

To build and run svLis programs, you will need to install the Apple
OpenGL libraries in your Extensions folder. These can be obtained from
ftp://ftp.apple.com//developer/opengl/opengl_install.hqx

You will also need to install the Apple OpenGL SDK,  available from
ftp://ftp.apple.com//developer/opengl/opengl_sdk.hqx

The Apple OpenGL SDK and svLis folders should both be in
the same folder on your hard disk, so that the header files 
and stub libraries required can be found.

Read the file mac_install.html in the docs folder to see how to
install svLis and get up and running with the example programs.

When building the test programs, this can take a long time (and a lot of
memory), especially for the "refinery" program. This can be reduced be
lowering the level of compiler optimisation using the Preference Panel in
Codewarrior, if you have a slow machine or memory is tight.

Note that svLisLib and SvlisUserLib are shared libraries.  When your
programs are compiled, these shared libraries are needed to run your
programs so

 (1) Put a copy of them in your Extensions folder, or
 (2) Make sure they (or an alias to them) are in the same folder as your
     built application.

All of the svLis documentation is available in HTML.  Point your
favourite browser at svlis.html in the docs folder to read it.
