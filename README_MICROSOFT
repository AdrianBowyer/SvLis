Svlis needs the OpenGL library to do graphics.  If you have Windows 95/8/NT 
you should have this; for further details see:

    http://www.opengl.org/

All svLis systems also need the GL User Toolkit (GLUT), obtainable from the 
same website.

To make svLis, build all the projects in the projects directory, starting 
with user_lib.

To test svLis after making it, run the console application

   bin\sv_tst_1

from this directory.  Then run

   bin\sv_tst_2

and then

   bin\sv_tst_g
