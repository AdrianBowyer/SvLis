SvLis is a set-theoretic (CSG) geometric modeller written in C++.  It is extremely legacy software.  I wrote it about 15 years ago, and have not done any work on it at all since around 2008.

All the clever ideas in it were from my old friend John Woodwark (http://johnwoodwark.com/).  On the other hand, I did all of the work...

I am putting it on Github in case anyone finds it useful.  I am afraid that I will not answer any technical or other queries about it.  That's one of the reasons why I retired.
