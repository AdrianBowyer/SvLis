 <P>This team is doing research on the representation of a geometric
 object by a single real continuous function of several variables
 as F(X) >= 0. We call it the "function representation" or F-rep.
 We try to combine many different models like traditional
 "implicits", skeleton based "implicits", sweeps, set-theoretic 
 models, volumetric and parametric objects. The main goal is to develop
 a rich system of geometric operations and relations. Our approach
 is based on the R-functions - Ck continuous definitions
 of set-theoretic operations. We apply the theoretic results
 in different areas: reconstruction from medical data,
 physically based simulation, artificial life, aesthetic design 
 and others.

<P> We plan to use svLis in research and education.
