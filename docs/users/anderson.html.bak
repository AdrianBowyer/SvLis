   The objective of our work on CAD-Based Vision is two fold.

   Our primary aim is to generate computer vision programs automatically from
   CAD 'drawings'. These programs should then be able to recognise real
   examples of the objects. We test these vision programs in both a robot
   workcell and in outdoor scenes.

   Our secondary aim is to construct CAD 'drawings' semi-automatically from
   video footage. We work with footage of indoor scenes using an uncalibrated
   camera and with footage from the robot workcell using a self-calibrating
   camera.

   We currently use Svlis and a proprietry CAD modeller in this research.
