Spatial Automation Laboratory</A>
at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison focus on spatial and physical modeling in support of
 industrial automation - so that physical artifacts can be represented,
analyzed, designed, and manufactured based on computer representations and
algorithms.
One  particular

the laboratory
explores how  interference  detection in solid modeling might be
accelerated using  real-function  representations  of solids.  Several
existing tools are used for computations and visualization of the results,
including  Matlab,
