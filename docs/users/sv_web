AB,

I was a bit engloomed to find no new svLis leads awaiting me on my return, on
any medium.  I have just checked, and we have NO sensible prospects, except 
perhaps the VR people.  I will chase them but I don't hope for much....

Our only other iron in the fire is the letter to CGW, which is not much of a
promotional strategy, even by our standards.

CSG 96 will be an opportunity to 'showcase' svLis, but I think will backfire
somewhat if we have to admit to only half-a-dozen users, even at $10pm.  (The
alternative is to lie through our teeth.)

We will not be able to mail the CSG 96 programmes until January or maybe Feb,
which is probably a little late to try to turn our svLis fortunes around.

I am still keen on the idea of a WWW 'magazine' for CSG, implicits, etc; but I
didn't sense great enthusiasm from your direction, which is understandable.
Perhaps it would be better to concentrate on svLis-specific stuff for the
moment.

Which brings me back to the vexed issue of pictures etc.  I could possibly do
some myself for publicity in January, but if we want to move more quickly, then 
it's up to you.  How about putting the idea of a 'leaflet' on ice, and just 
pepping up the Web page a bit.  If we had ONE - just one - decent picture, I 
could put it on a postcard (I have acquired quite a lot of promising new 
addresses recently, from various sources), and send that round to advertize the 
Web page, to which I could also direct any enquiries resulting from the CGW 
letter.

I can't quite remember what's on the svLis page at the moment.  I presume that
it already includes:

1.  A spec./list of 'features'/explanation of CSG.
2.  Prices
3.  A pointer to your VM project.
4.  Pointers to the InGe page and our biogs.

Does it have:

5.  A tutorial, showing how easy svLis is to use?  (A few chunks of the Manual
    would do for a start).
6.  The Contents List for the Manual?
7.  A bibliography?  (Again, the one from the Manual would do for a start.)
8.  Pointers to the nD FR work?  Do you have e.g. the pictures from the
    FR talk on the Web anywhere?  And how about the Voronoi stuff?  We need to
    show 'The Future'.
9.  A list of users (okay, only 8 at present, including the freebies, but we
    could call it 'a selection' or something), with pointers to their home
    pages and a short synopsis of what they're doing with svLis?  (I can be
    responsible for pestering them for this.)
10. More PICTURES?  It wouldn't hurt if some of these were low-res, or
    wire-frames etc. showing svLis 'in action', as it were.

Also, I wonder whether you found out anything about logging WWW browsers:
how many there are, which pages they access, for how long etc and, preferably, 
their e-mail addresses?
