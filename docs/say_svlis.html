<P>The svLis geometric modeller has been used (among other things) by archaeologists
for reconstructing models of ancient and long-since-crumbled buildings.
One such reconstruction was of the Roman remains in Bath.
<P><A HREF="http://www.bath.co.uk/">Bath</A> is a city in the west of England
that has existed since before Roman times. When the Romans came they built
one of the most famous spa complexes in the ancient world, with hot springs
and a temple at their centre. The Latin for Bath was Aquae Sulis - waters
of Sul. Sul was a pre-Roman Celtic goddess who presided over the hot springs,
and the Romans adopted her. They wrote the letter U as V, so Aquae Sulis
became Aqvae Svlis, though they pronounced `Svlis' (as far as anyone can
tell) with the modern U sound: soo-liss, with the emphasis on the first
syllable.
<P>The Great Bath (ray-traced by svLis above) still exists and still holds
water (I've been swimming in it), but the building around it has gone.
The blue colour is perhaps over-romantic -- today the water is more khaki
green, and I suspect that it was when the Romans were here too. Sadly,
you can no longer swim in it either. The waters are infected (and have
been since Roman times) by a meningitis-causing bacterium, so splashing
about in them is not now allowed. There is a project under way to renovate
the whole Spa and to connect it to a deeper-drilled and therefore uncontaminated
hot spring in time for the Millennium.
<P>The svLis geometric modeller has a Latin motto: PERFICTA PERFRACTA QVAERENDO
PERFECTA, which should not be too difficult for you to translate, especially
if you've read the <A HREF="book/svi2.html">svLis book</A> and therefore
know how svLis works. As far as I can tell at the time of writing, there
is no really good Latin dictionary on the web. However, you may care to
check <A HREF="http://eng.hss.cmu.edu/langs/">here</A>.
