<P>This version of svLis uses <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/opengl/">Apple
OpenGL</A> (see the file README_MAC in the main svLis folder for details
where to get it, and how to set it up), an implementation of <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</A>.
Note that it is currently a pre-release, and as such there may be problems
with it.
<P>The svLis distribution file for Macintosh is a .sit file which should
be unstuffed with Stuffit Expander. A folder called
<TT>Svlis</TT> will
be created. This folder and the <TT>OpenGL SDK</TT> folder should be put
in the same location on your disk. (The latter contains the OpenGL distribution
including headers and stub libraries needed for building programs which
use OpenGL, although in simple cases you will probably just use the graphics
procedures provided by svLis rather than writing OpenGL yourself.) Note
that the Mesa system extensions and appropriate enabler should be placed
in the System <TT>Extensions</TT> folder.
<P>To build svLis, you will need <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com/">Metrowerks
CodeWarrior Pro 4</A> or later. You must start by building the svLis precompiled
headers, and then the svLis user library, before trying to build the example
programs. See below.
<P>Three project files are supplied. Follow the instructions below in the
order given.
<P>The first project file, <TT>SvlisHeader.mcp</TT>, builds the svLis precompiled
headers which are needed for fast compilation of the other two projects.
<P>Open this project, select <TT>svlis.pch++</TT>, and choose
<TT>Precompile</TT>
from the <TT>Project</TT> menu. This builds the precompiled header and
puts it in the include folder. (You will only ever need to do this again
if you change any of the header files.)
<P>The second project file, <TT>SvlisUserLib.mcp</TT>, builds the svLis
User Library (for making the parts of svLis that are user-modifiable);
sources to build a default version of the library are provided.
<P>Open this project, and choose <TT>Make</TT> from the
<TT>Project</TT>
menu. This builds the svLis User Library,
<TT>SvlisUserLib</TT>, and puts
it in the bin folder. (You only ever need to do this after changing any
of the files in the
<TT>sv_user</TT> folder.)
<P>The third project file, <TT>SvlisExamples.mcp</TT>, builds the example
programs. There are targets for each example, and an
<TT>All</TT> target
which makes all the example programs.
<P>Open this project, select the <TT>All</TT> target (or the target for
a particular program), and chose <TT>Make</TT>.
<P>The files and directories that you will end up with in the
<TT>Svlis</TT>
folder will be:
<OL>
<LI>
<TT>bin</TT> - directory, contains applications and svLis shared libraries
(and debugger files if you make debugging versions).</LI>

<LI>
<TT>data</TT> - directory, contains test data</LI>

<LI>
<TT>docs</TT> - directory, contains the documentation</LI>

<LI>
<TT>include</TT> - directory, contains the svLis <TT>.h</TT> files and
the precompiled header</LI>

<LI>
<TT>programs</TT> - directory, contains source code of test programs and
other utilities</LI>

<LI>
<TT>results</TT> - directory, where the test programs store output</LI>

<LI>
<TT>SvlisExamples.mcp</TT> - the CodeWarrior project file for making the
example programs</LI>

<LI>
<TT>SvlisExamples Data</TT> - the data file for the above</LI>

<LI>
<TT>SvlisHeader.mcp</TT> - the CodeWarrior project file for making the
precompiled header</LI>

<LI>
<TT>SvlisHeader.Data Data</TT> - the data file for the above</LI>

<LI>
<TT>SvlisUserLib.mcp</TT> - the CodeWarrior project file for making the
parts of svLis that are user-modifiable</LI>

<LI>
<TT>SvlisUserLib Data</TT> - the data file for the above</LI>

<LI>
<TT>sv_user</TT> - directory, contains the source code for <TT>SvlisUserLib</TT>.</LI>
</OL>
When building the examples or <TT>SvlisUserLib</TT>, you may get several
linker and compiler warnings mainly due to duplicated definitions. These
may generally be ignored.
<P>SvLis uses SIOUX for console output. To avoid problems, you should not
change any of the SIOUX settings.
<P>After you've done those 3 steps check if all is working by runing the
program <TT>sv_tst_1 </TT>in the<TT> bin </TT>folder. This will create
a single file in the directory <TT>results</TT> called
<TT>sv_tst.mod</TT>
(examine it with CodeWarrior if you like; it will start something like:

though the numbers will be different). The file created is a svLis model
of a cube intersected with a sphere. If you run
<TT>sv_tst_2</TT> in the
<TT>bin</TT>
folder this will read the model, then divide and facet it, then print some
statistics. Finally running <TT>sv_tst_g</TT> should produce a picture
of the model. The faceting of this picture
is deliberately crude; you can refine it by picking the `Facet quality'
menu item with the RightButton menu. Typing `?'
in the graphics window gives a list of options and an explanation of how
OpenGL deals with a 3 button mouse on the Mac by using control, option and
command. Also, if you turn texturing on from the menu, you should get the
svLis logo tiled across the flat faces.

<P>Note that the example programs are built with a reasonable amount of
memory and stack space, but if you produce a larger model, or refine the
example on a lot, you may run out of memory, and need to use larger values.
This can be adjusted using the target settings panels for the project which
builds the examples.
<P>There are a number of other programs provided with svLis; for details
of them see the <A HREF="book/node9.html#ab900">svLis manual here.</A>
