             LEASES for purposes of RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT



SvLis is a set-theoretic kernel modeller: a piece of computer software 
developed by Information Geometers Ltd in collaboration with the 
University of Bath, and marketed worldwide by Information Geometers.

A svLis Research and Development lease permits the use of svLis of for a 
specific period.  As well as the svLis software, support and upgrades will 
be supplied during the period of the lease.  Additionally, user interfaces 
written by Information Geometers, together with other tools and test 
models, as available, may be supplied without extra charge.


COMMERCIAL USE

Svlis R & D leases are available to commercial and academic users on the same 
terms.  However, R & D leases do not include the transfer of ownership, 
copyright, or any other intellectual property rights in any software or 
documentation.  It is not permitted to lend, transfer, lease, sub-license 
or in any other way supply copies of svLis, or copies of software 
containing svLis, except to the users specified in the order form, and 
under the conditions laid down in this lease.

Licences permitting the resale of products containing svLis may be 
obtainable by negotiation.


CODE SUPPLIED

A svLis R & D lease permits the use of compiled versions of svLis which will be 
supplied for the types of computer specified.  Disassembly or alteration 
of svLis are expressly forbidden.

Source code licences may be obtainable by negotiation.


USERS

A svLis R & D lease permits a specified group of people to use svLis.  It does 
not refer to a specific computer or network.  However, the scope of a 
single lease is limited to one physical site or campus.

Programming users are permitted to write application programs and to link 
them to svLis.  All leases include one principal programming user, and 
other named programming users may be added to the lease.

The specified number of unnamed application users is the maximum number of 
non-programming users (in addition to programming users) who are permitted 
simultaneously to use svLis applications, whether such applications are 
written by programming users under this lease, or supplied by Information 
Geometers Ltd.  (So this would be the maximum class size, when svLis is 
used for teaching purposes).


SUPPLY OF SOFTWARE AND UPGRADES

A svLis R & D lease includes the supply of code to the principal programming 
user over the Internet.   There is no restriction on the methods that may 
subsequently be used to distribute code to the other registered users, or 
to make bona fide backup copies.

Information Geometers reserves the right to upgrade svLis, balancing 
technological improvements against users' need for stability.  After the 
expiry of a lease, it is not guaranteed that the version originally 
supplied can be provided again, or supported.


SUPPORT

Support will be available to all named programming users by e-mail sent to 
svlis@inge.com.  While Information Geometers will endeavour to deal 
promptly with problems and enquiries, no particular time for response is 
guaranteed.

Documentation is not included in the price of a svLis R & D lease.  Please see 
the Information Geometers book catalogue for prices.


PERIOD AND EXPIRY OF LEASES

Leases will run from 1 October in one year until 30 September in the next.  
New leases starting from January to June will run until 30 September in 
the same year.   New leases taken out from July until December will run 
until 30 September in the following year.  Prepayment is required for the 
entire period of the lease.

Information Geometers reserve the right to cancel a lease if the terms of 
this agreement are considered to be broken, or if demands for maintenance 
are deemed unreasonable.  If a lease is cancelled, Information Geometers 
will make a refund in respect of all full months unexpired.

The lessee agrees not to attempt to use any software supplied after the 
expiry of a lease, and Information Geometers reserves the right to ensure 
that the software supplied cannot be so used.


WARRANTY

Information Geometers will at any time accept cancellation of a svLis
R & D lease, and make a refund in respect of all full months unexpired.

Information Geometers makes no further warranties, and will not accept 
further liability for damage or loss, however caused.

A svLis R & D lease expressly precludes the use of the software supplied in any 
safety-critical application.

                                  * * *

All rights not specifically granted by this lease are reserved by 
Information Geometers Ltd.  If any part of this lease shall be deemed void 
or unenforceable in any country, that shall not affect the other terms of 
the lease.

DESCRIPTION
A CSG solid modeller accessed through a C++ API.  Primitive shapes are combined 
using set-operators, and graphics and geometric data are extracted from the 
resulting models using space-division techniques.

HIGHLIGHTS
* No boundary evaluation: preserves the inherent robustness of CSG.
* Programmable space division: processes large CSG models efficiently.
* Parameterized models can be defined within C++.
* Geometric data types, overloaded operators, and geometric transforms.
* User-defined primitives as well as natural quadrics etc.
* An inbuilt faceter supports fast rendering.
* Models may include sheets and wires as well as solids.
* Automatic sub-model commoning: handles multiple versions efficiently.
* An attribute class which supports inheritance.
* A mature technology: CSG space division has been researched since 1980.

LEASES
Leasing rates for R & D use, per month: PC version GBP 8.00 / USD 12.50; Sun or
SGI version GBP 11.00 / USD 17.50; any two versions GBP 16.00 / USD 25.00; all 
three versions GBP 19.00 / USD 30.00.  All leases include one named programming 
user.  Extra named programming users at GBP 3.50 / USD 6.00 per month.  Extra 
(unnamed) application users at GBP 1.00 / USD 1.50 per month.  All prepaid 
annually, but unexpired months will be refunded on cancellation.  We can send a 
lease agreement to you over the net.  Please contact us to negotiate source 
licences and/or licences permitting the resale of products containing svLis.
