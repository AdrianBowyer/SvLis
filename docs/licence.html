&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source-code leases for purposes of commercial exploitation



SvLis is a set-theoretic kernel modeller: a piece of
computer software developed by Information Geometers Ltd in
collaboration with the University of Bath, and marketed
worldwide by Information Geometers.

A svLis commercial lease permits the use of svLis source
code for a specific period and the sale of applications
containing svLis.&nbsp; As well as the svLis software, user
interfaces written by Information Geometers, together with
other tools and test models, as available, may be supplied
without extra charge.


COMMERCIAL USE

Svlis commercial leases do not include the transfer of
ownership, copyright, or any other intellectual property
rights in any software or documentation.&nbsp; It is not
permitted to lend, transfer, lease, sub-licence or in any
other way supply copies of the svLis source code.

A holder of a svLis commercial lease may write application
programs and link them to svLis and may sell copies of
compiled code derived from the svLis source code and the
leaseholder's code.&nbsp; For each copy of a program containing
svLis that is sold, a royalty of US $100.00 is payable to
Information Geometers Ltd.

A holder of a svLis commercial lease is responsible for
maintaining a complete record of sales of programs
containing compiled svLis code, and for supplying
Information Geometers Ltd with such a record within one
month of the end of each quarter of the year: on 31 March,
30 June, 30 September and 31 December.&nbsp; Information
Geometers Ltd will then invoice the holder of the svLis
commercial lease for the royalty payment, which is due
within one calendar month from the date of the invoice.
Late payment incurs a penalty of a 5% surcharge per month
or part-month.

CODE SUPPLIED

The holder of a Svlis commercial lease will be supplied
with the source code for all the C++ procedures in the core
svLis library and source for all the other parts of svlis
that are available free from the svLis web site at

http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ensab/G_mod/Svlis


SALES OF COMPILED CODE

A svLis commercial lease permits its holder to sell
COMPILED svLis code.&nbsp; It does not limit software
development to a specific computer or network.&nbsp; However,
the scope of a single compiled-code sale is limited to one
physical site or campus per copy sold.


SUPPLY OF SOFTWARE AND UPGRADES

A svLis commercial lease includes the supply of source code
to the lease holder over the Internet.&nbsp; There is no
restriction on the methods that may subsequently be used to
make bona fide backup copies.

Information Geometers reserves the right to upgrade svLis,
balancing technological improvements against users' need
for stability.&nbsp; Commercial licence holders are expected to
upgrade their copy of svLis when a new version becomes
available.&nbsp; Such upgrades will be made available to all
commercial licence holders at no extra charge.&nbsp; Only the
version of svLis that is current at any date will be
supported.


SUPPORT

Support can be made available to one named programming user
at the commercial leaseholder's organization for a further
charge of $1000 US per year.&nbsp; Support may be obtained by
the named programming user from e-mail sent to
svlis@inge.com.&nbsp; While Information Geometers will endeavour
to deal promptly with problems and enquiries, no particular
time for response is guaranteed.


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is not included in the price of a svLis
commercial lease as all svLis documentation is available
free from the svLis web site at:

http://www.bath.ac.uk/~ensab/G_mod/Svlis/


PERIOD COST AND EXPIRY OF LEASES

Commercial leases will run for one year from the date that
payment is received by Information Geometers Ltd.&nbsp; The code
will be made available to the leaseholder by FTP on that
date and an email will be sent on that date advising the
lessee that this is so.&nbsp; Payment is required in advance for
each year's lease.&nbsp; The first year costs US $2000.00.
Subsequent years cost $500.00 each.

Information Geometers reserve the right to cancel a lease
if the terms of this agreement are considered to be broken,
or if demands for support are deemed unreasonable.&nbsp; If a
lease is cancelled, Information Geometers will make a
refund in respect of all full months unexpired.

The leaseholder agrees to destroy all svLis source code and
not to sell any further programs or products incorporating
svLis after the expiry of a lease that has not been
renewed.&nbsp; Information Geometers reserves the right to
ensure that the software supplied cannot be used after the
expiry of a lease.&nbsp; Leaseholders can still access the free
version on the Web, and their customers can continue to use
any software with which they have already been supplied.


WARRANTY

Information Geometers will at any time accept cancellation
of a svLis commercial lease, and make a refund in respect
of all full months unexpired.

Information Geometers makes no further warranties, and will
not accept further liability for damage or loss, however
caused.

A svLis commercial lease expressly precludes the use of the
svLis software supplied in any safety-critical application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *

All rights not specifically granted by this lease are
reserved by Information Geometers Ltd.&nbsp; If any part of this
lease shall be deemed void or unenforceable in any country,
that shall not affect the other terms of the lease.
